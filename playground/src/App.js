            (CNN)The last US troops have left Bagram Air Base, according to a US
            defense official, marking the end of the American presence at the
            sprawling compound that became the center of military power in
            Afghanistan. The full withdrawal of US troops from the country is
            not complete yet but expected very soon. Nearly two decades after
            the first American troops arrived at Bagram and helped take control
            of the field after the 9/11 attacks, the transfer of the field to
            the Afghan military proceeded without fanfare, a hushed finale that
            portends the imminent conclusion of America's longest war. Once a
            dilapidated runway that barely had electricity in the surrounding
            buildings, the airfield became a small city in its own right,
            complete with shops, gyms, and classrooms for the thousands of
            servicemembers and contractors who worked at the base and its
            facilities. The two-mile runway, streaked with the dark black tire
            marks of countless takeoffs and landings, was the jumping off point
            for military operations throughout the country, with space for cargo
            aircraft, fighter jets, and attack helicopters. Presidents George W.
            Bush, Barack Obama and Donald Trump all visited Bagram during their
            time in office, promising victory and a better future for
            Afghanistan.
